# Squish-Friends
Squishy Chess is just like regular chess.  Except all of the pieces are squishy.  You have all of your loveable squishies, such as pawns, rooks, knights, bishops, the queen, and of course, the king.  The squishes can eat one another and cause a great loss of squishiness, but the game only ends when the king is in checkmate.

In order to play Squishy Chess, compile the driver file Woo.java, run it, choose a colour, then play until you can squish no more.
